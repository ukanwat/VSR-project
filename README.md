## Video Super Resolution for Edge Devices

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for video super resolution on edge devices such as mobile phones with low energy consumption. As the final year project, the focus will be on researching and implementing efficient algorithms that can enhance the quality of low-resolution videos in real-time. I'm currently writing a research paper under the guidance of the project supervisor to showcase the findings and results.
