## Video Super Resolution for Edge Devices

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for video super resolution on edge devices such as mobile phones with low energy consumption. As the final year project, the focus will be on researching and implementing efficient algorithms that can enhance the quality of low-resolution videos in real-time. I've used the repo structure from BasicVSR to make it easier to collect and process Video Data  and benchmark my results. I'm currently writing a research paper under the guidance of project supervisor to showcase the findings and results.
> **Note**
This project is ongoing and will continue to be updated with new findings and improvements. As the research progresses, I'll be implementing new techniques and refining the model to achieve even better results.
